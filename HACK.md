About

Join us to build tools for the real world. üåê 


RealFi Hack is a global virtual hackathon for builders working at the edge of technology and tangible impact. We‚Äôre looking for projects that push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible when decentralized systems and open tools are applied to real-world coordination challenges‚Äîfrom funding and financial access to trust, identity, AI, and planetary governance.


The hackathon tracks highlight some of the most urgent ...
üåê Logos x Tor: Privacy Infrastructure
üß©Challenge Overview

The Tor network provides essential privacy infrastructure for the internet. Meanwhile, Web3 unlocks programmable money and decentralized applications. Together, they open the door to next-generation privacy tools‚Äîwallets, RPCs, paymasters, and networks that protect users from surveillance and metadata leakage.


This track invites hackers to choose from a curated list of bounty ideas that explore how Web3 and Tor (and related technologies) can be combined. Builders may implement one idea, remix multiple ideas, or propose their own variation inspired by the list.


üëâ Explore the full set of bounties here:

    Composability of Private RPCs
    Private Paymaster Transactions with Onion Routing
    Private RPC Node Network
    Private RPCs for Account Abstraction
    Resilient Privacy Wallet
    Sustainable Privacy Infrastructure
    Beyond Tor: Mixnets for Ethereum Privacy
    Scaling Tor with Community Bandwidth & Token Incentives
    Incentivized Private RPC Nodes
    Privacy-Focused Wallet Prototype
    Next-Gen Privacy Networks


üìã Submission Essentials

    Demo or prototype implementing one or more ideas from the bounty list
    Documentation covering:
    Which bounty (or combination) you selected
    Design choices, privacy guarantees, and limitations
    How Tor (or similar networks) is integrated
    Short demo video (‚â§5 minutes) walking through your project
    Create a new post on the Logos Forum - https://forum.logos.co - introducing the project you built using the same information from the documentation for the hackathon.
    (Optional) Join Logos Discord or encrypted community to share your project to our community.


Judging Metrics

    Privacy strength ‚Äì How well does it mitigate metadata leaks?
    Technical feasibility ‚Äì Solidity, RPC integration, Tor/mixnet routing, etc.
    Usability ‚Äì Accessibility for average users
    Creativity ‚Äì Original approaches or combinations of listed challenges


‚öôÔ∏è Required Technologies

    Tor (SOCKS5, onion services, or Brume integration)
    Explore using Waku for messaging and Nimbus Execution Client for private RPC use cases (check out the Waku Cheatsheet)
    Ethereum/Web3 stack (wallets, smart contracts, RPCs)
    (Optional) Mixnets, PIR, or ZK proofs for advanced privacy
    (Optional) Frontend frameworks (React/Next.js) for demos

Example project ideas

    Private Paymaster ‚Äì Route transactions through onion services
    Privacy-First Wallet ‚Äì Prototype a wallet with stealth RPCs, ZK proofs, or mixer integration
    Incentivized RPC Network ‚Äì Create a registry of Tor-based RPC nodes with operator incentives
    Hybrid Privacy Stack ‚Äì Combine Tor with mixnets or PIR for stronger guarantees
    Tokenized Bandwidth ‚Äì Experiment with incentive models to scale Tor-based services

Prizes
$4,000, split between 1‚Äì2 winning teams & Keycard hardware wallet per team member
